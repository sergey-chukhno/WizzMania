# Cyberpunk Cannon Shooter

A C++/SFML port of a Next.js Brick Breaker game, transformed into a Cyberpunk Space Cannon Shooter.

## 🎮 Game Description

Control a cannon at the bottom of the screen and shoot energy projectiles upward at descending enemy blocks. Projectiles bounce off walls, blocks, and the cannon itself. Clear waves of blocks to progress through increasingly difficult levels.
