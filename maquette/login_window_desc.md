Create a **professional UI mockup of a login page** for a modern chat application called **“Wizz Mania”**, designed in the **same visual style as a futuristic glass-based messenger UI**.

#### Global Style

* **Ultra-modern, futuristic glass design**
* Frosted glass panels with soft blur and transparency
* Rounded corners, subtle shadows, depth layering
* Clean typography, minimalistic but premium
* Playful, light sarcasm referencing retro-era messengers (without copying any trademarks)

#### Layout Requirements

* Centered login card floating above a blurred futuristic background
* Background can be:

  * Abstract futuristic city
  * Soft gradient with subtle light particles
* Login card must include:

  * Application logo: “Wizz Mania”
  * Short tagline with playful tone (e.g. *“It’s not 2003, but you can still log in”*)
  * Username field
  * Password field
  * Primary “Sign In” button
  * Secondary actions:

    * “Create account”
    * “Offline mode” or “Guest mode” (optional)
* All inputs and buttons should appear **embedded into glass panels**

#### Light Mode Variant (for this image)

* Bright, soft color palette
* Light frosted glass (white / pale blue tint)
* Subtle accent colors for buttons and focus states
* Clear readability and calm atmosphere

#### Interaction Details (Visual Only)

* Input fields show focus glow
* Primary button slightly elevated with glass highlight
* Icons inside inputs (user, lock)
* Optional animated hint (typing cursor, loading glow)

#### Tone & Intent

* Feels **premium and modern**
* Slightly ironic about old-school messengers being “revived”
* Must look like a **real product login screen**, not a concept sketch
* Designed to serve as a **visual reference for implementing the Qt login window**

#### Output

* Single high-resolution UI mockup
* Clean, centered composition
* No device frame (desktop application focus)
* No copyrighted logos or branding
